# TDT4102 Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming
A repository made for my work on the assignments solved in C++ in this course, spring 2023.

### Prerequisites
There have been developed an extension for VSCode called "TDT4102 Tools" to be used in this course. To run the code simply call the "TDT4102: Create project from TDT4102 Template" function. You might need to go to the extension and push "Glob" if you get compilation errors.

The litterature used in this course is the 2nd edition of [Bjarne Stroustrup: Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++](https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html) with ISBN 9780321992789.
